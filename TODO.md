## To-do List

## Must have done
 - Re-generate output txt file for same fixed point result
 - Re-generate weight & bias text file
 - Generate not only first image but the other images

## Not required for 627 project
 - Organize functions for Cifar10 dataset -> Need to check accuracy with dynamic quantization
 - Make a function that support dynamic quantization for quantization-aware training
 - Make a function that support dynamic quantization for post-quantization training
 - On top of those functions, make a function that dynamically find proper fixed point during the training
